# Econometrics Labs

Here are econometrics labs from the econometrics class I took in the fall of 2014.
Econometrics was a great class, and I'm archiving my work here for the purpose of building a portfolio.
(That class as a ton of work).

* Stata code is in the Code folder.
* Unorganized Stata output is in the Output folder.
* Lab Writeups are in the Writeups folder. If they seem very rigid in format, it is because they were graded on a draconian rubric and any deviations from "The Form" were penalized.
